# Kubernetes Implementation Checklist

This document provides a consolidated checklist of all implementation tasks across the five phases of the Endpoint Statistics application deployment.

## Overview

This checklist tracks the progress of implementing the Kubernetes-based infrastructure for the Endpoint Statistics application. Each task should be marked as completed once it's successfully implemented and tested.

## Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure Setup

- [ ] Create namespace
- [ ] Create persistent volume claims
- [ ] Deploy PostgreSQL
- [ ] Deploy Redis
- [ ] Deploy Flask API
- [ ] Configure Ingress
- [ ] Set up secrets
- [ ] Verify connectivity between services
- [ ] Test basic API functionality
- [ ] Validate resource limits are appropriate

## Phase 2: Monitoring and Observability

- [ ] Deploy Prometheus
- [ ] Configure Prometheus scraping
- [ ] Deploy Grafana
- [ ] Configure Grafana data sources
- [ ] Create initial dashboards
- [ ] Configure Service Monitors
- [ ] Set up logging with Fluentd
- [ ] Configure alert rules
- [ ] Deploy AlertManager
- [ ] Test monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Verify alert notifications
- [ ] Validate log collection and analysis

## Phase 3: Security Implementation

- [ ] Apply network policies
- [ ] Configure RBAC roles and bindings
- [ ] Set up security contexts
- [ ] Implement pod security policies
- [ ] Configure secret management
- [ ] Set up TLS for ingress
- [ ] Implement image security controls
- [ ] Test security configurations
- [ ] Verify access controls
- [ ] Document security procedures

## Phase 4: Deployment Strategy

- [ ] Configure deployment strategy
- [ ] Set up rolling updates
- [ ] Configure blue-green deployment (if needed)
- [ ] Set up canary deployment (if needed)
- [ ] Implement scaling rules
- [ ] Configure StatefulSets for stateful components
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Configure rollback procedures
- [ ] Set up CI/CD integration
- [ ] Test deployment process
- [ ] Verify scaling behavior
- [ ] Test rollback procedures
- [ ] Document deployment procedures

## Phase 5: Monitoring and Maintenance

- [ ] Set up Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Configure basic and advanced monitoring visualizations
- [ ] Configure backup procedures
- [ ] Set up backup verification and testing
- [ ] Create disaster recovery plan and scripts
- [ ] Implement maintenance automation
- [ ] Create health check scripts
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts
- [ ] Document performance tuning guidelines
- [ ] Create capacity planning document
- [ ] Test backup and restore
- [ ] Verify monitoring setup
- [ ] Document maintenance procedures
- [ ] Implement log retention policies

## Final Verification

### Functionality Tests

- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Data is stored and retrieved from PostgreSQL
- [ ] Redis caching functions properly
- [ ] Load balancing works correctly
- [ ] Ingress routes requests properly

### Security Tests

- [ ] Network policies restrict traffic correctly
- [ ] RBAC permissions work as expected
- [ ] TLS encryption is functioning
- [ ] Secrets are properly protected
- [ ] Pod security policies are enforced

### Performance Tests

- [ ] System handles expected load
- [ ] Autoscaling triggers at appropriate thresholds
- [ ] Response times meet requirements
- [ ] Resource usage is within expected ranges

### Disaster Recovery Tests

- [ ] Backup procedures complete successfully
- [ ] Restore procedures recover the system correctly
- [ ] System recovers from simulated failures
